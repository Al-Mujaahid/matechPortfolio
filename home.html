        <p>My long social life in the tech field has gotten me having these tech gurus as my testimonial, those who have worked on many projects with lots of 
          experiences and networks, glad and proud of having them as my testimonial. Some of whom were of great help in me being who I'm today, and the other 
          of whom we were great pals in our journey of becoming programmers. Nice to have these great connections with these pros, hoping to have many more 
          great connections as I explore and dive more into this field.</p>

              It's a pleasure being one of your refrees Abdullah. Abdullah has collaborated with 
              me in building a number of apps, including those that have to do with API integration. Over our long 
              time of relationship, he has proven himself to be worth befriending and teaming up with.
              Good luck to you as you establish your connection with him.
